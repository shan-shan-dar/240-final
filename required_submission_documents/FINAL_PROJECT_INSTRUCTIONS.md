# CMSC 240 - Fall 2025  
## Final Project

### Overview

The final project will be completed in **teams of 2–4 people** and will demonstrate your understanding of advanced C++ topics, project management, documentation, and user-centered design. Your project idea can be anything you want (e.g. an API, a game, a simulation, a software app, anything) so long as a majority of the source code is written in C++.

Your team will design and implement a software system for real users. The project should address a problem or need, be evaluated by end users, and include documentation, testing, UML diagrams, and a final presentation.

## Dates

| Date | Deadline |
| :----: | :------- |
| Nov-7 | Project Proposal due |
| Nov-21 | Project Check-in due (prototype and prototype end user feedback due) |
| Dec-8 | Project Presentation and Final Project repository due (same time as exam) |

## Project Proposal

This is where you will plan your project, identify end users for the system and how you will received evaluation from them. Your project scope should be within reason and feasible -- you only have about a month to create it from scratch! 

Your **proposal** must include the following sections:

1. **Problem Description**  
   - Define the problem and how your project will address it.  

2. **End Users (4 total)**  
   - At least **2 must be external** (outside of your group project team -- preferably all of them).  
   - Describe each user’s background as it relates to your project and explain how and why they will use your system.  

3. **Feature Requirements (5 total)**  
   - Identify five required features that your project will implement (these may come from your end users).  

4. **Background Research**  
   - Describe similar systems and explain how yours differs or improves upon them.  

5. **Timeline of Implementation**  
   - Provide a development timeline with the following milestones:  
     - What features will be implemented and by when.  
     - Deadlines for prototype and final user feedback.  

   - *NOTE: The project check-in date is 11/21. Your prototype and end user feedback for the prototype should be completed before this date*

6. **End User Feedback Plan**  
   - Each end user must provide feedback twice:  
     - **Prototype stage** – open feedback on early version.  
     - **Final stage** – completion survey using a 1–5 satisfaction scale for each of the 5 requirements listed from the project proposal:  
       - 0 = Not implemented
       - 1 = Meets little to no expectations
       - 2 = Meets some expectations  
       - 3 = Meets most expectations  
       - 4 = Meets all expectations  
       - 5 = Beyond expectations  
     - Ease of use rating (1-5): 1 = Extremely difficult to use the program, 5 = Extremely intuitive to use the program.  

---

## Check-In Presentation (3–5 minutes)

During your check-in presentation, you must provide:

1. **Four prototype surveys** and summaries of user feedback.  
2. A **working prototype** with at least **three required features** implemented.  
3. A **detailed plan** for feature updates and final implementation.  

---

## Final Project Submission

Your final submission must include:

### Repository Requirements
- A complete **GitHub repository** with:
  - All source code files.
  - **Makefile** for building the project.
  - **README.md** file including:
    - Team member names.  
    - Project purpose and description.  
    - Installation instructions for any external libraries.  
    - How to compile and run.  
    - Example usage.  
    - Screenshots of the program.  
    - A section describing any AI tools used (including chat conversation links).  
  - **Changelogs** documenting major feature updates.  
  - **User Surveys** from both prototype (done on 11-21) and the final version of the program.  
  - **UML Diagrams** showing classes and relationships.  

### Code Quality
- All functions must have **docstrings or inline documentation**.  
- Code must be **fully functional and error-free**.  

---

## Final Presentation (10–15 minutes)

Your team’s final presentation should include the following sections:

1. **Problem** – The issue your project addresses.  
2. **Background** – Research and rationale for your design.  
3. **Design Plan** – UML overview, architecture, and design rationale.  
4. **Implementation Details** – Key code structures and logic.  
5. **Example Usage** – Live demo or screenshots.  
6. **User Feedback** – Summary and reflection on survey results.  
7. **Reflection** – Lessons learned and potential improvements.  

All team members must speak, and your presentation must last between **10 and 15 minutes**.
